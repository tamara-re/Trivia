Submitted by: Tamara Regalado Quiroz

**Trivia** is an app that has different questions for the user to answer and displays the number of correct answers and resets your game. 

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- I wish that I knew how to style the image a bit nicer, I also hoped to add more style to the buttons.
